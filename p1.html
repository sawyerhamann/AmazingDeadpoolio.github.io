		<h3>Hello, my name is Sawyer Hamann.</h3>

		<p>Hello and thank you for visiting my profile!<br/><br/>
			Starting off, I spent my years after high school transferring between a lot of universities and fields of study.
			I originally started in music at Northwest University in Kirkland, WA.
			Then I transferred over to Eastern Washington University where I studied mechanical engineering for a brief period before transferring again to the Visual Communication Design program.
			After two years at Eastern Washington University, I transferred for the last time to Southeastern University in Lakeland, FL though I did all of my study online through the Ministry Institute program at Puyallup Foursquare Church in Puyallup, WA.
			In April of 2016 I earned my Bachelor of Science in Ministerial Leadership from Southeastern University.<br/><br/>
			I've been working as an ALT in Japan with the JET Program for over three years now and I spent one year before in Japan as an Eikaiwa school teacher.
			My career in Japan started with NOVA Holdings in Shizuoka Prefecture, where I worked for one year before returning to the United States.
			After some time in the U.S. pursuing other work, I applied to and was accepted by the JET Program.
			I originally started in a small village called Kamikitayama in the mountains of Nara Prefecture, teaching kids ranging in age from kindergarten to 9th grade.
			The school was very small, only 7 students in the entire school, so I was able to hone my teaching skills.
			After just over two years in that village, I got married and I was transferred to the city of Tenri where I currently do the same work with the same age range of students but on a much larger scale.
			I rotate between three elementary schools and a junior high school on a fixed schedule teaching four to six classes of about 30 students each every day.<br/><br/>
			During the year and a half between coming back from Shizuoka and leaving again for Nara, I went back to school to learn how to become a machinist.
			While a student, I worked at an indoor shooting range and then later at a machine shop that manufactured parts for Boeing among other clients.
			During my schooling I learned the basics of manual machining, CNC, and even how to write G-code and use CAD software.<br/><br/>
			Now, I'm continuing to expand my skills and endeavoring to greater heights by attempting to get a full teacher's license for Nara Prefecture.
			Simultaneously, I'm also taking a translation and interpretation course offered by the JET Program as well as a course in Android Development through the Google Developer program.
